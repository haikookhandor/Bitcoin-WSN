The goal is to create a community trustworthiness metric that minimises shifts in community trust. We thereby try to make an understanding of the network’s stability with respect to the trustworthiness.

The prevalence of online trade has increased as a result of recent technology developments. However,
this has sparked worries about theft and fraud, particularly on websites where users’ identities are
kept secret, like Bitcoin OTC. It has become vital to gauge user reputations and comprehend how
new users affect existing communities in order to mitigate this risk. The who-trusts-whom signed
network can show both good and bad user relationships. Due to the dynamic nature of the trust
levels in such networks, they are susceptible to link and node failures. The goal of this research is to
create a community trustworthiness metric that minimises shifts in community trust. We thereby
try to make an understanding of the network’s stability with respect to the trustworthiness.

### Problem Statement
Given the weights of a signed network, our task is to devise a metric denoting the trustworthiness
of a community within a network. Further, we establish a relation between the
trustworthiness metric value for each cluster and the corresponding change in the predicted
weights upon the introduction of a new node.
